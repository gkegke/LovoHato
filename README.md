# Problem: You have too much content (images, video, music etc).

You want to create a 'fine-tuned' set, maybe for AI image generation that match a certain condition. OR just want to filter all the content into a smaller group you know you love.

Result: It can be effortful to do so, especially if you have 100s if not 1000s of items to filter.

LovoHato attempts to simplify and speed up the filtering of media (images, audio and video) many at a time.

Note: Mainly for personal use, so it will likely be rough around the edges.

Currently supported OS:
